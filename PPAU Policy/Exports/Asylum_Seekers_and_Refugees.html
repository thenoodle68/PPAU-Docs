<p>= Asylum Seekers and Refugees</p>

<p>== Preamble</p>

<p>Handling of asylum seekers is one of the great policy failures of recent years. Domestically, political and legal processes are mired in buck-passing and blame - a dysfunction mirrored in wider regional disputes.<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Aus faceoff</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Regional refugee protection</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Immigration detention in Aus</span></a> The backlog of boat arrivals has overwhelmed capacity for processing, drownings at sea continue to escalate, and growing evidence is emerging of inept and inhumane handling of the problem in Australia and overseas.<a class="citation" href="#fn:4" title="Jump to citation">[4]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">RCA sub</span></a></p>

<p>A crisis on such a scale requires a regional solution. We believe efforts should begin at once to set up a single regional asylum seeker &#8216;queue&#8217;. Asylum seekers arriving anywhere in the region would be subject to a single processing system overseen by an independent body with all participating nations accepting a share of approved refugees. The existence of a common regional queue would remove specific incentives to travel to Australia, reducing drowning and deterring backdoor economic migration. A transparent allocation process should reduce disputes between nations, and pooling of information should improve document and identity checking. The creation of a new system of oversight allows for a best practice approach built from the ground up, with a humane appeals process and a means for swift and safe return of arrivals deemed not to be asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Such a scheme would require funding, leadership, and specific incentives provided by Australia to encourage sign-up. However, Australia currently spends over $1 billion per year on detention facilities,<a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">4 steps</span></a> and redirection of these funds will free up significant resources. Nations such as Indonesia would have strong incentives to sign up, both to receive aid, and to obtain help with settling their own large backlog of asylum seekers. As participating countries would be required to sign the UN Refugee Convention, funding and aid from Australia could become a mechanism for improving region-wide standards in asylum seeker handling.</p>

<p>Asylum seeking is lawful, and detention should not last longer than the minimum time-frame necessary to assess claims and conduct health and security checks. Approved asylum seekers can be brought into the community, provided with support and training, and settled in areas where jobs remain persistently vacant (the National Farmers Federation estimates around 96,000 jobs are unfilled in regional areas).<a class="citation" href="#fn:6" title="Jump to citation">[6]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Labour shortage</span></a></p>

<p>The Pirate Party believes it is past time that our response to the plight of vulnerable people embodied our best qualities instead of our worst.</p>
