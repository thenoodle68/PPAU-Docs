<p>= Foreign Policy and Treaty Making</p>

<p>== Preamble</p>

<p>Civil and digital liberties, transparency, and human rights are universal principles and should be embodied in foreign as well as domestic policy. Indeed, foreign and domestic spheres are often difficult to separate, with international treaties having potential to drive domestic lawmaking.</p>

<p>Like all legal mechanisms, treaties derive legitimacy through consent and consultation. For this reason, treaties such as ACTA (which affect surveillance, <a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">ACTA</span></a> generic medicine,<a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Blank cheque</span></a> and digital rights), have drawn concern due to the intense secrecy surrounding their formulation and negotiation. While the secrecy itself was nullified by regular leaks, the process was still seen to exclude many potentially affected parties. Far more legitimacy and balance will attach to treaty outputs when openness and participation are enshrined in the negotiation process, and potential threats to sovereignty are removed.</p>

<p>Recent revelations of massive and warrantless monitoring by the US National Security Agency also demand an alternative, and stronger response from the Australian government. Australians are being subjected to offshore monitoring on a massive scale with no checks and balances and no access to appeals or accountability. The notion that allies can be treated as suspects with no rights is harmful both to domestic sovereignty and broader international relations. One method of safeguarding the liberties of internet users will be to ensure that foreign whistle blowers offering information relevant to the public good are granted protection under Australian whistle blower laws. We also believe negotiations should commence on a new treaty to enshrine the principles of the internet and protect the rights of its users.</p>

<p>Australia should also continue to support human rights overseas, with the first step being to meet agreed aid targets. Plans to redirect foreign aid to handle domestic boat arrivals set a bad precedent and should be reversed. Properly targeted aid may well do more to reduce such arrivals in the long-run by curbing poverty and environmental damage overseas.</p>

<p>Foreign humanitarian aid should be provided for genuine humanitarian reasons, and in a manner that supports the improvement of local conditions. It is sometimes the case that aid is provided to foreign nations in situations where the real benefit is to the business and producers in the donor countries and the aid actually has negative effects upon the recipient countries.<a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Hidden dumping</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:4" title="Jump to citation">[4]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Aid as dumping</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Wasted wealth</span></a> For example the increase in US rice delivered to Haiti as food aid in the wake of the disastrous earthquake of 2010 has out further pressure on local producers already struggling after years of their market being flooded by cheap, heavily subsidized US rice and very low tariffs imposed by the IMF. <a class="citation" href="#fn:6" title="Jump to citation">[6]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Food imports hurt</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:7" title="Jump to citation">[7]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Haitian farmers</span></a></p>
