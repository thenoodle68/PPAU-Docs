<p>= Civil Liberties</p>

<p>== Preamble</p>

<p>Civil liberties are essential to all of us, being a balance to the power of the state, a source of freedom and progress, and the core of civil society. History records a long fight for liberty, with even basic rights such as freedom from slavery, freedom of speech and freedom from torture won with great difficulty and frequent reverses. The digital age has provided stunning progress in this age-old struggle: many hierarchies including old-style media and government centralism have been recast or overthrown, creating space for citizen engagement and new voices.
As individuals have become more empowered, co-operation and trust between citizens and the state has become increasingly important. Trust and co-operation between citizens and the state ultimately underpin our collective security. Laws which nullify civil liberties in the name of security are counter-productive because they undermine this trust. The historical truism that security is not won through the sacrifice of liberties has never been more true than in the digital age.</p>

<p>=== Freedom of speech and related rights ===</p>

<p>Freedom of speech is not only a key civil liberty in itself, but a safeguard for other liberties. It protects not just the right to speak out, but also the right to hear and be exposed to ideas. Racism and other offensive ideas have generally lost power most swiftly in the freest societies, where they have been most effectively refuted. However, refutation can happen only when offensive ideas are permitted expression. Restrictions on speech undermine this process and rob the public of its collective capacity to judge parties and persons on the basis of full and free information.
While laws which criminalise “offensive” or “insulting” speech<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">18C</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">18C repeal</span></a> may be well-intentioned, mechanisms such as section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act impose dangerous subjectivity into our legal system. The perpetual risk in criminalising offensiveness is that almost any form of difference or disagreement can be viewed as offensive to someone, and nations such as the UK and Canada have experienced significant abuse of such laws.<a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Kung Fu Fighting</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:4" title="Jump to citation">[4]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Blasphemy law</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Canadian hate speech reg</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:6" title="Jump to citation">[6]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">US freedom to offend</span></a> Even where protections technically exist, the mere threat of legal sanction may be sufficient to chill dialogue and speech, and recent events demonstrate that restrictions on one type of speech spread all too easily to include wider categories.<a class="citation" href="#fn:7" title="Jump to citation">[7]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Anti discr bill</span></a>
Recent censorship bills also threaten to infringe free expression. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007 bans &#8220;praise&#8221; for terrorist acts (which are defined vaguely and broadly),<a class="citation" href="#fn:8" title="Jump to citation">[8]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Classification amendment</span></a> while the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999/2001 imposes arbitrary restrictions on viewing of a range of otherwise legal consensual activities.<a class="citation" href="#fn:9" title="Jump to citation">[9]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Censorship bill</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:10" title="Jump to citation">[10]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Libertus classification amendment</span></a> We support a classification system which facilitates choice by providing information, but reject any creep into broader censorship under which citizens have such choices made on their behalf.
Freedom of speech underpins other freedoms including freedom of thought, conscience and assembly. It is past time that laws seeking to restrict these fundamentals were subject to proper consultation and debate, measurement of costs and benefits, and meaningful attempts to ascertain the likelihood of purported security threats. Fundamental principles warrant evidence-based policy.</p>

<p>=== Justice ===</p>

<p>The legal system should err on the side of civil rights and free speech. Journalist shield laws are a key in this regard: press freedom cannot exist without the right to protect sources, and the absence of protection can result in concealment of information essential to the public interest. Although nominal shield laws exist, journalists continue to face prosecution from powerful individuals for nothing more than protecting confidentiality.<a class="citation" href="#fn:11" title="Jump to citation">[11]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Need shield laws</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:12" title="Jump to citation">[12]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Phone demand</span></a> To curb this, the right to protect a source needs to be strengthened by including a right for journalists to protect the content of information passed on in addition to the identity of the source. The power of inquiries to publicly expose sources must also be curbed, since such compulsion threatens the very forms of journalistic investigation which have so often been essential to inquiries launching in the first place.
Balance and equality within the legal system can be improved by unwinding recent laws aimed at loosening thresholds for detention, search and seizure, and restoring proper judicial oversight.<a class="citation" href="#fn:13" title="Jump to citation">[13]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Coag</span></a> Finally, we believe the system should embody the principle of one law for all, applied to all persons equally. The Pirate Party does not support parallel legal systems and other forms of law which impose differential standards.</p>

<p>=== Privacy ===</p>

<p>Privacy is an essential underpinning of human dignity and free expression. It encompasses not just physical privacy, but the freedom to control your cultural presence, and manage the information and identity that surrounds you. A trusting and free democratic society cannot function without the protection of a person&#8217;s private life and sphere. Surreptitious and intrusive surveillance is toxic to trust, social harmony and the integrity of the state.
The Pirate Party will always support privacy and oppose attempts to nullify it. We want a higher threshold of privacy to be codified across the totality of laws in Australia. This can be done both by introducing tougher legislative requirements for organisations retaining data, and improving options available to individuals seeking to protect their personal privacy.
In addition to supporting further protections of human dignity through the curtailing of state-sponsored surveillance, Pirate Party Australia recognises that the pervasiveness and continual expansion of private and public recording equipment pose serious implications for privacy. Free expression will be significantly curtailed if all aspects of people&#8217;s lives are subject to orchestrated or ad hoc surveillance. As such, we support the enactment of a statutory tort that covers both intrusions into seclusion as well as misuse of private information.</p>

<p>=== Dignity and freedom from pain ===</p>

<p>No liberty is more fundamental than the right to live free of pain and physical torment. We support the right of adults of sound mind, facing terminal illness, and with appropriate safeguards, to end their lives with dignity and peace if they so choose. Contrary to frequent claims, support for voluntary euthanasia is not a statement of any kind on the value of life. It encompasses no more than respect for the right of persons to decide on such weighty questions for themselves, in the context of their own private circumstances. We believe politicians should represent the views of citizens, not use political office to impose religious views into the private sphere. Bans on voluntary euthanasia create a painful legacy of unmanageable suffering, lost dignity, and the sacrifice of free choice.</p>
