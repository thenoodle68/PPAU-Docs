<p>= Cultural Participation</p>

<p>== Preamble</p>

<p>Culture is a pillar of our lives, having evolved with us through thousands of generations, building on what has gone before and connecting people to each other and to our collective history.
However, intellectual property laws have recently imposed a misshapen model of culture, molding it into a hierarchical structure in which grassroots creators are squeezed out and the creations of the past century are placed under perpetual private control.<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Shrinking public domain</span></a> Live music venues and other participatory avenues are becoming increasingly scarce,<a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Closing live venues</span></a> <a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Melb loses venue</span></a> <a class="citation" href="#fn:4" title="Jump to citation">[4]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">SA music danger</span></a> <a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Live under threat</span></a> even as corporate owners of music are forbidding remixing and other essential aspects of musical creativity and evolution.<a class="citation" href="#fn:6" title="Jump to citation">[6]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Kookaburras</span></a> And while digital avenues provide substantial new ways to experience culture, traditional cultural hubs are likely to need greater support to fully harness their potential.
Part of the cultural challenge is addressed through reform of intellectual property laws (see copyright policy). However, such reforms should be supplemented with active efforts to help artists and promote grassroots cultural models which better reflect both our own creative nature and the increasingly participatory nature of the digital age. Successful cultural policies should emphasize grassroots participation and access, not hierarchical structures and artificial scarcity.</p>
