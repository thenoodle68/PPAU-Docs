<p>= Marriage</p>

<p>== Preamble</p>

<p>The Marriage Act in current form denies same sex couples a human right which is taken for granted in mainstream, heterosexual society. The Marriage Amendment Act 2004 pushed this discrimination further by imposing a declaration, compulsorily recited at all weddings, that marriage in Australia is an exclusionary institution only to occur between a man and a woman.<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Marriage ammendment</span></a> This imposes religious principles into state ceremonies, undermining the separation of Church and Stateâ€”a principle which lacks explicit protection in the Australian Constitution.<a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Fading seperation</span></a> It also feeds existing stigmas related to homosexuality, which cause significant harm: discrimination against same-sex couples is known to cause alienation, anxiety and depression, and the rate for suicide attempts among LGBT is 2.5 times higher than that of the general population.<a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Marriage equ and health</span></a> The repercussions place a large burden on our health system.<a class="citation" href="#fn:4" title="Jump to citation">[4]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Healthcare and equ rights</span></a></p>

<p>As the modifications enacted in 2004 demonstrate,<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Marriage ammendment</span></a> the Marriage Act is too easily used as a vehicle for political grandstanding, to the detriment of equality and civil liberties.<a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Human rights sub</span></a> Protecting marriage is not a matter of excluding particular individuals: we should instead exclude the state, which has shown itself to be incapable of overseeing fair and proper marriage laws. We accordingly support returning marriage to the community and replacing the Marriage Act with a Civil Unions Act. This will offer equal treatment to same-sex couples, and help to ensure that all Australian citizens receive the same recognition and legal rights.</p>
