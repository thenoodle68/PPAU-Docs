<p>= Animal Welfare</p>

<p>== Preamble</p>

<p>The Pirate Party is opposed to animal abuse and believes our laws should be informed by scientific research which demonstrates the capacity of animals to feel emotion and pain.<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Do animals have rights</span></a> The improvement of public understanding through transparency and scientific discovery has been crucial to improvements in animal welfare to date, and we believe in the further application of these principles. Accordingly, we support existing efforts to create an independent statutory authority to conduct research and improve animal welfare outcomes. We also support improvements in the level of transparency applying to animal products.</p>

<p>The Pirate Party believes live exports need to be examined, with ongoing efforts made to promote chilled meat exports as an alternative to the live cattle trade: live exports are characterized by months-long voyages, unsanitary conditions and total absence of any freedom of movement, with a significant follow-up risk of abuse in destination countries.<a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Animals Aus investigation</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Transport of livestock</span></a> Efforts to improve live export conditions—in conjunction with sensible domestic reforms—offer the best chance for a &#8216;net&#8217; gain in global animal welfare.</p>
