<h1 id="digitallibertiespolicytext">Digital Liberties Policy Text</h1>

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<p>The grassroots nature of the Internet is causing considerable disruption to traditional power structures.<a class="citation" href="#fn:1" title="Jump to citation">[1]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Secret treaty</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:2" title="Jump to citation">[2]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Global effort to curb</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">telecom data retention overview</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:4" title="Jump to citation">[4]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Internet Enemies</span></a> Unsurprisingly, this is leading to push-back: corporate and government entities have been trying for years to increase control over the Internet through a range of measures including censorship, reduction of access, treaties to reduce the rights of Internet users, and ever-broader surveillance and monitoring powers.<a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">No tolls</span></a>
Attempts to control the Internet take different forms over time, but all are justified through references to crime and other undesirable activities. They also all share one critical flaw: they are easily evaded by those with technical knowledge. They ultimately reduce the freedoms of the public while doing nothing to curb criminal behaviour. The Pirate Party will always defend the founding principles of the Internet, and resist any and all attempts to control it. A fast and free Internet, open to all, is a safeguard not just for our economy and culture, but for our basic rights.</p>

<h3 id="netneutrality">Net neutrality</h3>

<p>Net neutrality is a fundamental principle behind the development of the Internet. It ensures that the Internet is free and open to all by preventing gatekeepers from blocking, speeding up, or slowing down content based on the source, destination or owner. Net Neutrality guarantees that even the smallest entrepreneurs have the same access standards as established firms.<a class="citation" href="#fn:5" title="Jump to citation">[5]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">No tolls</span></a> The absence of such a guarantee would represent a perpetual threat to generations of new entrants.
Content providers and ISPs have undermined net neutrality by seeking to differentiate among different forms of information and data flow, and impose priorities. Abandoning Net Neutrality and subjecting Internet traffic to a commercial veto will hurt competition and innovation, and allow service providers to preference or block protocols and force consumers to use less desirable options.
Free, open and non-discriminatory access to the Internet is essential for our democracy and for our economic well-being and the Pirate Party will seek the adoption of clear net neutrality principles to protect the Internet from the introduction of any discriminatory practices.</p>

<h3 id="dataretention">Data retention</h3>

<p>Surveillance of the public is expanding constantly, and has reached a point which threatens essential trust between the state and the citizen.<a class="citation" href="#fn:6" title="Jump to citation">[6]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Web inventor says bad idea</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:3" title="Jump to citation">[3]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">telecom data retention overview</span></a>
Plans have been tabled to expand surveillance further which would force ISPs to retain telephone and Internet data for 2 years, and force people to reveal their passwords on demand. This is a gross invasion of privacy and will create a vast database of material. Ultimately this database could become accessible through many channels not mentioned in the legislation, including subpoenas. The database will pose little threat to criminal activity, since many technical avenues currently exist through which data retention can be avoided.
While data retention is only a proposal at present, recent revelations show that Australians are already subject to an array of secret, warrantless spying on emails, chats, photographs, documents and website addresses.<a class="citation" href="#fn:7" title="Jump to citation">[7]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Prism</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:8" title="Jump to citation">[8]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">intel mining data</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:9" title="Jump to citation">[9]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">NSA slides explain</span></a> Such spying poses little threat to terrorists: terrorist forums are not indexed by most search engines and do not inhabit the servers targeted by the PRISM program.<a class="citation" href="#fn:10" title="Jump to citation">[10]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Jihadism</span></a> However, mass-trawling of personal data poses a significant threat to the liberties of the global public and undermines cooperation and trust between citizens and the state. Unrestricted surveillance of the public combined with total obscurity for the state is untenable. Far more legitimacy, trust, and effectiveness will be earned by applying proper oversight and inbuilt protections for civil liberties, including proper use of warrants.</p>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>Internet censorship proposals create a permanent infrastructure for web blocking, and connect it to a permanently shifting category of banned content. The RC classification has been altered frequently by parliament and has become patchwork and inconsistent.<a class="citation" href="#fn:11" title="Jump to citation">[11]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">refused classification</span></a> We believe that the government should look to adequately funding law enforcement, removing illegal content and prosecuting those responsible for the manufacture of the material, rather than funding a filter that slows connection speeds, is liable to wrongly block websites and is easily circumvented.
Households may choose censorship programs for their own use, but that is the prerogative of parents: they must be permitted to make decisions for their own families, and the government should trust them to do so responsibly.
New censorship proposals come on top of existing, secret censorship mechanisms. Section 313 of the Telecommunications Act has been used by officials to block access to around 250,000 legitimate websites to date, with no application of oversight and accountability.<a class="citation" href="#fn:12" title="Jump to citation">[12]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">notice 2821</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:13" title="Jump to citation">[13]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">ASIC spiderweb</span></a><a class="citation" href="#fn:14" title="Jump to citation">[14]<span class="citekey" style="display:none">Secret blocking</span></a> We believe the rampant misuse of this provision warrants its removal, with any replacement clause to be subject to proper consultation and higher legislative standards.</p>
